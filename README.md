### About Every Country in the World (ECitW)

Every Country in the World (ECitW) is a small project intending to gather basic information about countries all around the world. The project was designed and built by [Modou Lo](https://twitter.com/thisismodou) using the wonderful [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) API. The entire project code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/thisismodou/Every-Country-in-the-World).
